  Discover the range of tools that allow you to interact with Unicode

A number of tools exist through which you can explore the relationship between scripts, languages and characters, in particular the [web-based resources](https://r12a.github.io/applist#scripts) developed by Richard Ishida.

You can also use applications directly in your computer. The Unicode Consortium has developed [Unibook Character Browser](https://unicode.org/unibook/help/unibook.htm) as a resource for Windows; this also requires you to download and install related [character property data](https://unicode.org/unibook/help/unibook.htm#InstallingPropertyData). 

An alternative application for Windows is [BabelMap](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html).

For macOS, [UnicodeChecker](https://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker) is a utility that is comparable in scope.

For characters in the CJK blocks in Unicode, UnicodeChecker also summarizes information derived from the [Unihan Database](https://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html).
