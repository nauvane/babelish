{{% alert title="Tip" color="primary" %}}
Both Windows and macOS support **TrueType** (`.ttf`) and **OpenType** (`.otf`) fonts. Make sure that any fonts you download are in these formats, rather than webfonts.

### Unicode fonts

The most practical resource to access scripts encoded in Unicode is the **[Noto Project](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)**. You can browse which fonts you would like to install. [Noto Serif](https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/NotoSerif-unhinted.zip) includes all of the various Latin blocks in Unicode and much more besides, as you can see from <a href="/documents/Noto_Serif_Unicode.pdf" target="_blank">the full character set</a>.

[Charis SIL](https://software.sil.org/charis/) is also a useful font to install. Here is <a href="/documents/Charis_SIL_Unicode.pdf" target="_blank">the full character set</a>. 

For access to a very wide range of symbols in Unicode, you can turn to the font [Symbola](https://dn-works.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/UFAS-Fonts/Symbola.zip).

### Historical fonts

It is useful also to install fonts that include historical scripts that may no longer be in use, like Ogham, which is just one of <a href="/documents/Clara_Unicode.pdf" target="_blank">a large number of scripts</a> included in [Clara](http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/clara.zip). 

[Cardo](http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html), which describes itself as "is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists", is also <a href="/documents/Cardo_Unicode.pdf" target="_blank">a useful resource</a>.

### What a font encompasses

Typically, you will download a font in the form of a `zip` file. Once you have uncompressed it, you will find the separate files for different typefaces: typically **Regular** (or **Roman**), **Italic**, **Bold** and **Bold Italic**. 

Other fonts may contain a much larger range of weights.

You can choose to install all of these or simply the ones that you are most likely to find useful.

### Installing fonts in Windows

1. [Unzip the compressed file](/docs/applications/#utilities) containing the fonts.
2. Right click on an individual font file and select **Install**.
3. Repeat for further styles and weights.

### Installing fonts in macOS

1. [Unzip the compressed file](/docs/applications/#utilities) containing the fonts.
2. Double click on an individual font file.
3. When Font Book opens, select **Install Font**. As a rule, all of the styles and weights of the same font will be installed.
