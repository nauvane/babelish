  How to use Markdown in your work

### From Markdown to PDF

An open-source editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) allows you to write and to edit documents in Markdown, and to preview the content as it would appear in print or on screen. 

{{< figure src="/images/vscode.png" caption="A Markdown file in Visual Studio Code with preview" alt="A Markdown file in Visual Studio Code with preview" width="80%">}}

Other tools, like [Marked2](http://marked2app.com/) also allow you to preview a file and to export it for printing as a PDF. 

You can also apply stylesheets to determine the formatting of Markdown elements (e.g. headings, lists) in PDF files. 

Further tools, like [Markdown Plus](https://tylingsoft.com/markdown-plus/), allow you to combine several of these functions (there are versions for Windows and Mac). 

### Markdown as a common denominator

There are other tools that use Markdown as a common standard from which files in other formats (including word-processor formats, like Word) can be generated, notably [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).

Markdown can also be used in conjunction with [reference and research management tools](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/31269/add-on-to-use-markdown-in-zotero-notes), like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), many of which are open source.
