Many computer users find it more convenient to use the keyboard rather than a mouse or other device to enter commands. You will find that almost any aspect of the operation of an application can be controlled using keyboard shortcuts.

### System-wide shortcuts

Basic operations can be performed by means of shortcuts.

| Command      | Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Copy      | CTRL+C (Windows) or CMD+C (macOS)       |
| Cut   | CTRL+X or CMD+X        |
| Paste      | CTRL+V or CMD+V |
| Select all      | CTRL+A or CMD+A    |
| Undo an action   | CTRL+Z or CMD+Z         |
| Redo an action      | CTRL+Y or CMD+Y  |
| Save      | CTRL+S or CMD+S        |
| Save as   | CTRL+SHIFT+ S or CMD+SHIFT+ S         |
| Print      | CTRL+P or CMD+P        |
| Close the active document   | CTRL+F4 or CMD+W         |

If you find it convenient to use the keyboard to carry out operations like these, you will find a much fuller range of options in [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) and in [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236).

**Paste special** is a useful command: it allows you to paste copied material as plain text, in other words, without its original formatting. In Windows: CTRL+SHIFT+V; in macOS: CMD+OPTION+SHIFT+V.

### Shortcuts in word-processors

Many of the system-wide shortcuts function in word-processors and [Word](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/keyboard-shortcuts-in-word-95ef89dd-7142-4b50-afb2-f762f663ceb2), [LibreOffice](https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Shortcut_Keys_for_Writer#Shortcut_Keys_for_LibreOffice_Writer) and [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) all many additional commands that can be activated through the keyboard.

Here are some useful ones to keep in mind in using any of these applications.

| Command      | Shortcut |
