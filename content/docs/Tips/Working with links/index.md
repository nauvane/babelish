  Embedding hyperlinks in your documents
---

A **[hyperlink](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)** is an element of a document or webpage that links to a website or webpage, another document, or to part of the same or another document. Hyperlinks are key building blocks of the internet.

### Retrieving a link

Wherever you use an online source, you should provide a link to it. To go automatically to the address bar of a browser and highlight the current address, press CTRL+L (Windows) or CMD+L (macOS); you can then press CTRL+C or CMD+C to copy the link, so that you can insert it into your own document.

If you choose to insert a link into body text, it should always be incorporated into intelligible **link text**. Make sure that you write clear and helpful link text: for example, "<u>Smith's discussion</u> shows...", **not** "as you can see <u>here</u>". To create or insert a link in a word-processing application, press CTRL+K (Windows) or CMD+K (macOS).

### Kinds of link

At its simplest, a link is a current web address as displayed in a web browser. 

You will also find yourself using other types of link. A **persistent URL** is a link that is designed to be permanent and is often a feature of library catalogue pages.

Where one is provided, you should always make use of a persistent link.

A **digital object identifier** (**DOI**) is another important kind of link: it is a persistent identifier for a published item and should therefore be used in your bibliographies or lists of works cited. 

{{< figure src="/images/doi.png" caption="A digital object identifier in an academic journal" alt="A digital object identifier in an academic journal" width="80%">}}  

###  Links as references

Links can be used to document your sources. Make sure you follow the relevant [style conventions](/docs/useful-reading/#style-guides) in incorporating them into your work.
